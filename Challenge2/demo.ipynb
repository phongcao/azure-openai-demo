I also had a couple spots where the clear coat was coming off. Just small spots. I searched the options and chose this product because of the great reviews. In addition, I bought the application foams pads that were recommended. The instructions were fairly simple and I followed them exactly as instructed. After seeing no results, I tried a second time. The only difference I saw after both attempts was that the faded spots were much more visible. Instead of covering the spots, it highlighted them. The small spots where the clear coat was coming up grew larger. The day after applying the compound, there were residual marks all over, even after wiping off with a microfiber towel many times. This product did not work for me at all even though I followed the directions precisely. Afterwards I read more reviews. I experienced the same situation as others who gave a 1 or 2 star review. I did read that some tried it on their headlights. I will try it as I have a good deal of product left. I will test it on a very small section first though so as not to damage more of my car.\",\n",

However, this compound (plus, car wash, elbow grease and polish) really turned it around. Now it is only visible with a close inspection and leaving me happy to wait until much later in the car’s lifespan for a more professional restoration. I am really happy with this purchase and can whole heartedly recommend.\",\n",
